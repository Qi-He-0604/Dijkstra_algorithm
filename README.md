# Dijkstra_algorithm
Using Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm to find the shortest path between two locations on a map. ![Map](https://github.com/Qi-He-0604/Dijkstra_algorithm/issues/1)
Calculating the lowest cost from Boston to West Coast,  where the cost of shipping is the following:
1. First 500 miles between any two nodes, cost = $0.005 per pound per mile.
2. From 501 to 1000 miles between any two nodes, cost = $0.004 per pound per mile.
3. From 1001 to 2000 miles between any two nodes, cost = $0.003 per pound per mile.
4. Over 2000 miles between any two nodes, cost = $0.002 per pound per mile.
